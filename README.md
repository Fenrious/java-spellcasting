# Java-Cast
A game for learning the basics of Java.

Status: Early Demo. Still have lots of complicated things to hammer out over the summer. Current Project.

Note on the jar file: It uses java class file version 55. This seems to be a higher version than what is included on some operating systems. You may need to add a path in your environment variables to include java 11. I will try to bring it back down to java 8 later on.
